# uap-clj

A [`ua-parser/uap-core`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) based library for extracting browser and operating system information from a raw useragent string:

1. family
2. major number
3. minor number
4. patch level

Implementation is provided here for two different categories of use case: 1.) commandline processing of a textfile containing useragent strings, one per line or 2.) importation as User Defined Functions (UDFs) in the Hadoop Hive environment.

## Setup

Add this to the `:dependencies` stanza of your `project.clj`:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/uap-clj/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/uap-clj)

`uap-clj` depends on the file `regexes.yaml` actively maintained in the public [`ua-parser/uap-core`](https://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core) repository, as well as on the test fixtures `test_ua.yaml` and `test_os.yaml` contained therein. Be sure to run `lein deps` after cloning this code repository, and re-run on occasion to pull in changes committed to those `uap-core` assets.

To generate your classes and .jar files:

```bash
lein clean && lein deps && lein compile && lein uberjar
```

###Java and Hive version dependencies

This code has been tested and shown to run under Hive commandline versions 0.12.0 and 0.14.0 when compiled under Java v1.7 (Mac OS X v10.9.5):

```bash
â†’ java -version
java version "1.7.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)
```

## Use

### commandline (CLI)

Although this library was written with the overall goal of providing a small set of Hive UDF functions for extracting browser and O/S data from useragent strings, I've also provided a simple mechanism for creating a basic report outside Hadoop/Hive from the unix commandline:

```bash
/usr/bin/java -jar uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar <input_filename> [<optional_out_filename>]
```

This command takes as its first argument the name of a text file containing one useragent per line, and prints a headerless TSV (tab-separated) file - defaulting to `output.tsv` - with this line format:

`useragent string<tab>browser family<tab>browser major<tab>browser minor<tab>browser patch<tab>os family<tab>os major<tab>os minor<tab>os patch<newline>`

The output file is headerless and can be be trivially imported by your favorite spreadsheet or database ETL tool.

A Leiningen-based run option is available as well, which is particularly convenient during development:

```bash
lein run <input_filename> [<optional_out_filename>]
```

Note that these instructions assume you're using the standalone version of the project .jar file, for development & portability: this will get you running quickly, but it's almost always a better thing to use the mininal jarfile instead, since it _doesn't_ pull in 50Mb of dependencies. To enable this, you'll need to install prerequisite dependencies (specified in `project.clj`) on your classpath.

### Hive UDF

After generating a .jar file, `scp` it to your HDFS client host and then `hadoop fs -put` it in an HDFS directory (e.g. `hdfs:///shared/jars`), then confirm that doing an `ADD JAR` of the new jarfile succeeds:

```bash
hive> list jars;
hive> add jar hdfs:///shared/jars/uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar;
converting to local hdfs:///shared/jars/uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
Added [/tmp/e34eeeef-1af2-4af2-a92d-c2df813deb00_resources/uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar] to class path
Added resources: [hdfs:///shared/jars/uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar]
hive> list jars;
/tmp/e34eeeef-1af2-4af2-a92d-c2df813deb00_resources/uap-clj-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

Register your functions with names of your choice:

```bash
hive> create temporary function browser as 'uap-clj.udf.Browser';
OK
Time taken: 6.476 seconds
hive> create temporary function os as 'uap-clj.udf.OS';
OK
Time taken: 0.082 seconds
```

If you don't already have a source of useragent data in form of SELECTable columns of useragent strings in an existing Hive table, you can populate an external table by copying a text file comprising user agent strings, one per line, to a temporary location in HDFS:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE raw_useragent(agent STRING)
  ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
  STORED AS TEXTFILE
  LOCATION '/shared/data/raw/useragent';
```

Note that we've left off a FIELDS TERMINATED BY specification, since each line corresponds to one field. This is the simplest case of a Hive table, EXTERNAL or regular:

```bash
hive> describe raw_useragent;
OK
col_name	data_type	comment
agent               	string
Time taken: 0.735 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
```

Assuming you've moved a source text file (or several) to `hdfs:///shared/data/raw/useragent`, you should see a populated external table the size of the number of lines in your source file:

```bash
hive> select count(*) from raw_useragent;
[SNIP SNIP]
Stage-Stage-1: Map: 1  Reduce: 1   Cumulative CPU: 3.52 sec   HDFS Read: 1005886 HDFS Write: 5 SUCCESS
Total MapReduce CPU Time Spent: 3 seconds 520 msec
OK
_c0
6832
Time taken: 50.66 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)
```

Now you're ready to play with your data and try out your UDFs:

```bash
hive> SELECT agent, browser(agent) AS browser, os(agent) AS os FROM raw_useragent LIMIT 10;
OK
agent	browser	os

See that three output columns are specified in the query, but what looks like nine columns are displayed: that's because each of the UDFs - `browser()` and `os()` - return a simple Hive Text object comprising four strings concatenated by non-printing tab characters. To store these values cleanly and usably, you might consider creating a target table containing the outputs of the UDFs split on the embedded tab delimiters stored in columns of Hive `array<string>` type, e.g.:


```bash
hive> CREATE TABLE processed_useragent(
>     agent STRING,
>     browser array<STRING>,
>     os array<STRING>)
>   LOCATION '/shared/data/processed/useragent';
OK
Time taken: 0.315 seconds
hive> describe processed_useragent;
OK
col_name	data_type	comment
agent               	string
browser             	array<string>
os                  	array<string>
Time taken: 0.604 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)
```

Now populate this new table from the `raw_useragent` external table:


```bash
hive> INSERT INTO TABLE processed_useragent
>   SELECT agent,
>     split(browser(agent), '\\t'),
>     split(os(agent), '\\t')
>   FROM raw_useragent;
Query ID = hdfs_20150130215656_4903b8b1-00b4-4b2e-a40b-5bb296522d32

hive> select count(*) as rowcount from processed_useragent;

From this point, you can extract fields of interest in your reports following a variation of this basic pattern:

```bash
hive> SELECT agent AS logged_agent,
>   browser[0] as browser_family,
>   browser[1] as browser_major,
>   browser[2] as browser_minor,
>   browser[3] as browser_patch,
>   os[0] as os_family,
>   os[1] as os_major,
>   os[2] as os_minor,
>   os[3] as os_patch
> FROM processed_useragent LIMIT 10;
OK

The foregoing example is not intended for production applications, unless that's the way you like to roll.

## Future / Enhancements

What's up next:

1. Implement Device parsing;
2. Re-implement UDFs as GenericUDFs;
3. Refine Browser and OS parsing to deal with some apparently hairy regex substitution not accounted for in the initial Implementation;
4. Add memoization and/or LRU caching after various performance tests;
5. Write a preprocessor for the `speclj` testrunner which filters against text fixtures with no corresponding `regexes.yaml` entry (the need for which will become apparent to the user who runs `lein spec --reporter=d`.)

Pull requests will be very happily considered.
